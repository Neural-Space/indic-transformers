# MergedQUAD Dataset

MergedQUAD consists of splits for SQUAD-based Question-Answering in Hindi language. It is a combination of examples taken from other multilingual SQUAD-based Question Answering datasets like [XQUAD](https://github.com/deepmind/xquad) and [TyDiQA](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tydiqa). This dataset was introduced in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02323?context=cs.LG) titled "Indic-Transformers: An Analysis of Transformer Language Models for Indian Languages" which has been accepted as a workshop paper at ML-RSA (NeurIPS 2020). This paper presents an exhaustive study of transformer-based architectures on Indian languages like Hindi, Bengali and Telugu. 
You can find our models on HuggingFace model hub over [here](https://huggingface.co/neuralspace-reverie).
